about__description
Hey! I'm Jess and I am a first year University of Waterloo student
studying Computer Science. 
I was born in Kingston, ON, and later moved to Brockville, ON. 
I love being active, mostly aquatic sports as growing up on the
St.Lawrence means you cannot miss out on the joys of 
boating, swimming and tubing. That being said, I was apart of
the Upper Canada River Otters Swim Club based in Brockville, where
I consistently competed at the national standard. 
Nonetheless, I treat my academics the same way I found success in swimming.
I'm diligent and always trying to focus on the process. One of 
the most important lessons I got from swimming was that 
having a strong mindset is key. Hence, as a computer science 
student with no prior experience, I refuse to let that define
myself and my oppurtunities. I am eager to learn and dedicated
to finding my spot in the world of computer science.
